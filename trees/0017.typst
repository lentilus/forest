#title[ZFC+]

ZFC+ is obtained from #local("000I")[ZFC] by taking
- symbols from ZFC, and a new symbol $Mm$
- formulas of ZFC with one unquantified variable replaced by $Mm$
and the following axioms
- Equality axioms and logical axiom schemes of ZFC
- non-logical axioms of ZFC
- $Mm$ is countable and transitive
- $phi_(i)|_Mm$ with $phi_(i)$ any non-logical axiom of ZFC.
