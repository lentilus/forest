= Definition = Surreal Number 

This Definition is incomplete!

A surreal number $s$ is given by two sets $L$ and $R$ containing surreal Numbers themselves.
We write
$
{ space L | R space }.
$
Note! Not every choice of $L$, $R$ yields a unique surreal number.

The first surreal number $0$ is defined as ${ space | space }$.
With $L$ and $R$empty.

All other numbers are born through (transfinite) induction.
