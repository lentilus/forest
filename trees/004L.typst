#title[Solutions of the Pell equation as units]

We can identify a solution $(x,y)$ of the Pell equation with the pair
$xi overline(xi)$. In this case $overline(xi)$ is the inverse of $xi$,
since $xi overline(xi) =1$. From this point of iew, the solutions of
the Pell equation are precisely the units of $ZZ[sqrt(D)]$.
