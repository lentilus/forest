Let $a,b in NN$ and $p$ #local("0034")[prime] with $p | a b$ then $p | a$ or $p | b$.

#proof[
  We only need to show the case where $p divides.not a$. Because $p$ is prime, it has exactly the divisors ${1,p}$.
  $p$ does not divide $a$ so their only common divisor is $1$. Thus $gcd(a,b) =1$.
  We are done by applying #local("0039")[this corollary].
