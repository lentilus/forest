title: The Empty Type
---

We need to disable the K-Axiom, which is incompatible with Homotopy type theory
```agda
{-# OPTIONS --without-K #-}
```

In agda `Set` denotes the universe of small types. [somelink](005N.typst)

The _emtpy type_ is the type with no elements. It can be interpreted as a
proposition that has no proofs.
```agda
data 𝟘 : Set where
```

The elimination rule for elements of the empty type yields an element of any
depended type indexed by `x : 𝟘`. This is analogous to the idea, that you
can prove anything from falsehood.
```agda
𝟘-elim : {A : 𝟘 → Set} (x : 𝟘) → A x
𝟘-elim ()
```
Note that `()` refers to the impossible match. Since there is no `x : A`, there
is nothing to define for that branch.

We can define negation as a map that sends any type `A : Set` to `A -> 𝟘 : Set`.
```agda
neg : Set -> Set
neg A = A -> 𝟘 
```
