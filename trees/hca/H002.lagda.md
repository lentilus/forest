title: Empty Type
---

```agda
open import Cubical.Foundations.Prelude hiding (_∨_) public
```

The simplest type we can define in agda is the _empty_ type.
```agda
data 𝟘 : Type where
```
Since we are giving no way to introduce it, it has no elements.
Because we can be sure to never encounter an element `x : 𝟘`, we assume an elimination rule that gives us an element of any type `A` given `x : 𝟘`.
```agda
postulate
  A : Type

explosion : 𝟘 -> A
explosion ()
```
