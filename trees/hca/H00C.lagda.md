title: Some intuition on HoTT in Agda
---

<!--
```
open import Cubical.Foundations.Prelude
```
-->

HoTT is a foundation for mathematics based on _MLTT_.
In HoTT we don't have _sets_ like in ZFC, but _elements_ of _types_.

`A` is a type and `x : A` is an element of type `A`.
```
data A : Type where
  a : A
```

Pi Types / Dependent function types
```
id : A -> A
id a = a
```
