title: Natural Numbers

```agda
open import Cubical.Foundations.Prelude hiding (_∨_) public
```

We define the [natural numbers](/001J.typst) as follows.

```agda
data ℕ : Type where
  zero : ℕ
  suc : ℕ → ℕ
```

This is indeed enough and we do not need to worry about them being cyclic,
since for any `n : ℕ`, `suc n` wont be judgementally equal to `zero`,
unless we define it to be.
