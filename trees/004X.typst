#taxon[Theorem]
#title[Infinity of Primes]
There are infinitely many #local("0034")[primes]. 

#proof[
  Suppose $p_1,..., p_k$ are the only primes. Since $p_(1) dots.c p_k$ has a
  #local("0052")[prime factorization] there exists
  $1 <= i <= k$ with $p_(i)|p dots.c p_(k) + 1$. But $p_(i)|p_1 dots.c p_k$ so
  $p_(i)$ must also divide $1$. That is a contradiction.
