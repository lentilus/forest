#title[ZFC: Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice]

ZFC is a pure set theory meaning that every object is a set. It uses the same #local("000J")[logical axiom scheme] and inference scheme as #local("0000")[PA] -
but the resulting axioms are different.

The *Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms* are (TODO: write them out).
