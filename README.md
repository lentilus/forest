# An attempt at forester style note-taking
Using _typst_, _scribe_, _kodama_ and _zeta_

You can walk it [here](https://forest.lentilus.me).

## Rules for myself
- *Never* change the tag.
- Create new lib version if it breaks backwards-compatibility.
- Only include statements with proofs that I have come up with myself or feel comfortable reproducing.
- Always reference the *smallest possible subtree*.
